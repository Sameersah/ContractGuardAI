LEASE AND RENT AGREEMENTS:
- Security deposits should not exceed 1 month's rent (not 2-3 months)
- I want early termination option with 30 days notice and maximum 1 month penalty
- Maintenance responsibilities should be clearly defined - landlord handles major repairs (HVAC, plumbing, structural, appliances)
- I prefer month-to-month after initial lease term (not automatic renewal for another full year)

- I want clear parking policies - at least one space included, additional spaces at reasonable cost
- Late fees should be reasonable (not more than 5% of rent) with 5-day grace period

- Early move-in: Should be allowed if unit is available, with prorated rent
- Renewal terms: Should be negotiable, not automatically set to same terms

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS:
- Non-compete clauses should be limited to 6 months max and specific geographic areas
- I want to retain rights to work on personal projects outside work hours
- Severance should be at least 2 weeks per year of service
- I prefer unlimited PTO or at least 20+ days

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:

NEGOTIATION STYLE:
- I'm willing to compromise on payment terms if other protections are strong

- For leases: I'm willing to pay slightly higher rent for better terms (early termination, month-to-month after initial term)
